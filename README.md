# Learning Log
Simple web app where users can log in and make an entry about a topic

Some of the code is part of a tutorial from the book Python Crash Course but I am also building on it with my own features

# TODO
* Let users delete topic or entry
* Change login redirect from homepage to topic page
* Alow some topics to be publicly visible?
* Refactor
